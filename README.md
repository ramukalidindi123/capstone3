# Capstone Project - 3 : What Drives National Mortality Rates?
This is a Jupyter Notebook-based project analyzing global health statistics to explore which factors influence national mortality rates.
The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and regression modeling using Linear Regression, Random Forest, KNN, MLP, and XGBoost models.


# Business Understanding
We aim to understand what factors most influence a nation's overall mortality rate.
Specifically, is it driven by healthcare access, doctor-patient ratio, per capita income, education levels, or other factors?

# Goal: Provide insights and actionable recommendations for policymakers to prioritize interventions that can lower mortality rates.
